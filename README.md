2. irrigation.py: This file integrates the irrigation prediction Result into our platform.
3. plante.py: This file integrates the crop suggestions into our platform.

Both integrations are implemented using Flask API.

-the IOT Code folder contains the code that should be uploaded to the microcontroller after completing the wiring of all hardware components.
